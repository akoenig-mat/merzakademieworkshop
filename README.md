Such press releases dominate public opinion
and mystify current technologies into a utopia
to distract from their actual functioning and
dangers. The course gives an insight into the
functionality of such machine learning systems
and teaches the theoretical and practical use of
this technology.
For this purpose, we use Google's Word2Vec,
which forms the basis for all language-based
applications of the company, in order to ana-
lyze self-selected texts and check to what ex-
tent these systems actually "understand"
language.
In addition, we not only examine the technical
aspects but also pose the question of the un-
derlying understanding of language and set
this in relation to traditional language percep-
tions in cultural theory.
The aim is an interdisciplinary transfer of
knowledge, whereby technical content is ex-
plained by practical examples. Programming
knowledge in Python is advantageous but not
necessary.

Workshop contents and topics:
• Theoretical introduction to the history of AI
(from cybernetics to machine learning)
• Definitions of terms (What is "artificial intelli-
gence" etc.) and the different types of machine
learning
• Introduction to Anaconda, Python and the use
of Jupyter Notebooks
• Introduction to NLP (Natural Language Proces-
sing) by building a project with Word2Vec and
data-visualization that leads to a basic under-
standing of machine learning and its possible
use and dangers.
• Analyse Twitter data and bulid a „Fakedetec-
tor“
• Critical reflexion with texts by Walter Benjamin,
Gilbert Simondon, Jaques Derrida and Shosha-
na Zuboff

• Please prepare a short presentation to
introduce yourself and your interest in AI
(can also be just an opinion, no research
needed).
• Please bring a computer
