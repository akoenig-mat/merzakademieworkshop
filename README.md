##A critical introduction to machine learning*##

"Facebook’s artificial intelligence robots shut
down after they start talking to each other in
their own language"
The Independent 31 July 2017

Such press releases dominate public opinion
and mystify current technologies into a utopia
to distract from their actual functioning and
dangers. The course gives an insight into the
functionality of such machine learning systems
and teaches the theoretical and practical use of
this technology.
For this purpose, we use Google's Word2Vec,
which forms the basis for all language-based
applications of the company, in order to analyze self-selected texts and check to what extent these systems actually "understand"
language.
In addition, we not only examine the technical
aspects but also pose the question of the underlying understanding of language and set
this in relation to traditional language perceptions in cultural theory.
The aim is an interdisciplinary transfer of
knowledge, whereby technical content is explained by practical examples. Programming
knowledge in Python is advantageous but not
necessary.

Workshop contents and topics:
- Theoretical introduction to the history of AI
(from cybernetics to machine learning)
- Definitions of terms (What is "artificial intelligence" etc.) and the different types of machine
learning
- Introduction to Anaconda, Python and the use
of Jupyter Notebooks
- Introduction to NLP (Natural Language Proces-
sing) by building a project with Word2Vec and
data-visualization that leads to a basic under-
standing of machine learning and its possible
use and dangers.
- Analyse Twitter data and bulid a „Fakedetector“
- Critical reflexion with texts by Walter Benjamin,
Gilbert Simondon, Jaques Derrida and Shoshana Zuboff

- Please prepare a short presentation to
introduce yourself and your interest in AI
(can also be just an opinion, no research
needed).
- Please bring a computer
